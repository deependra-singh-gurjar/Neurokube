# NeuroKube Project Plan Document

## 1. Introduction

**NeuroKube** is an AI-driven container orchestration platform that builds upon the foundations of Kubernetes and Docker. It adds a cognitive layer to optimize container scheduling, dynamically allocate resources, and proactively manage anomalies through machine learning. This project aims to create a proof-of-concept (PoC) that demonstrates intelligent scheduling using reinforcement learning (RL) and paves the way for future enhancements like dynamic scaling and self-healing.

## 2. Objectives

- **Intelligent Scheduling:**  
  Develop a custom Kubernetes scheduler plugin that uses an RL model to optimize pod placement based on historical workload data and real-time metrics.

- **Proactive Resource Management:**  
  Utilize AI to predict resource demands, identify potential bottlenecks, and adjust resource allocation dynamically.

- **Continuous Learning & Auto-Healing:**  
  Build a feedback loop that continually refines the scheduling model based on actual performance outcomes, with plans to extend auto-healing capabilities in later phases.

- **Seamless Integration:**  
  Ensure that NeuroKube integrates with existing Kubernetes clusters, monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana), and DevOps pipelines.

## 3. Scope

### MVP Scope (Phase 1)
- **Feature Focus:**  
  Intelligent scheduling via a custom Kubernetes scheduler extension.
- **Data Collection:**  
  Integration with Prometheus to gather CPU, memory, and performance metrics.
- **AI Model:**  
  Develop a simple reinforcement learning model prototype to recommend optimal pod placements.
- **Integration:**  
  Implement a RESTful API within a microservice that interacts with the Kubernetes API.
- **Testing:**  
  Deploy on a local Kubernetes cluster (Minikube or Docker Desktop) for initial validation.

### Future Enhancements
- Dynamic resource allocation based on real-time predictions.
- Proactive anomaly detection and auto-healing features.
- Enhanced dashboards and reporting tools.
- Broader integration with CI/CD pipelines and additional cloud services.
